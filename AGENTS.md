# AGENTS.md: Project Code Generation Mandate

This project operates under a unified set of architectural and code quality standards. All AI code generation, review, and refactoring must adhere to the following documents:

1.  **Core Rules of Engagement:** See **[./RULES_OF_ENGAGEMENT.md]** for non-negotiable standards on testing (`Test Triad`), code style (`black`, `mypy`), data modeling (`pydantic`), and modularity.
2.  **Architecture & Tech Stack:** See **[./ARCHITECTURE.md]** for approved technology choices (e.g., Next.js, FastAPI).

**Behavioral Mandate:** Always review the files above before starting a complex task.
